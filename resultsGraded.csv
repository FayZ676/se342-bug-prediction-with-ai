1,Infinite Recursion,def print_numbers(n):\n    if n > 0:\n        print(n)\n        print_numbers(n),"The recursive call print_numbers(n) does not change the argument, leading to an infinite recursion and eventually a stack overflow error.","The error in this code is found in the indentation of the `print_numbers(n)` function. In Python, indentation is important and indicates the block of code that belongs to a function. Here, the first line after the function declaration should be indented to indicate it's inside the function.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
def print_numbers(n):
    if n > 0:
        print(n)
        print_numbers(n)
```",The error here is that the recursive function `print_numbers()` does not have a base case or a way to stop the recursion. This will result in an infinite loop and a potential stack overflow.,"The error is that the function is not recursive. The function will print the number and then stop. To make it recursive, we need to call the function again inside the function.",0,1,0
2,Mutable Default Argument,"def append_to_list(value, my_list=[]):\n    my_list.append(value)\n    return my_list","Using a list as a default argument will cause the function to use the same list on every call, leading to unexpected behavior when the function is called multiple times.","The function will not work as expected. The .append() method returns **None**, therefore the function will return **None**.
To append to a list and return the list, you could do the following:
```python
def append_to_list(value, my_list=[]):
    my_list.append(value)
    return my_list

x = [1, 2, 3, 4]
y = x.append(5)

x 
```","The error in this code is that the default argument `my_list=[]` will persist between function calls. 

This means that if the function is called multiple times without specifying a value for `my_list`, each call will modify and return the same list object.

To fix this error, you can modify the function to set the default value to `None` and create a new list inside the function if `my_list` is `None`. Here is the corrected code:

```python
def append_to_list(value, my_list=None):
    if my_list is None:
        my_list = []
    my_list.append(value)
    return my_list
```","```
SyntaxError: unexpected indent

We need to remove the space before the `:` in the second line, since this is a lambda function.",0,1,0
3,Name Shadowing,input = 'saved input'\ndef process_input():\n    input = input.strip()  # Trying to use the global input\n    return input,"The same name input is used for a variable inside the function and globally, leading to UnboundLocalError because the local variable input is referenced before assignment.","The error in the code is that the variable input is being used without being defined. The = symbol is used to assign a value to a variable, so input = input.strip() is trying to assign a value to input, which has not been defined. 

To fix the error, the following line could be inserted before the problematic line:
```
input = 'saved input'
```
This defines the variable input with the value 'saved input', so the line input = input.strip() will then assign the value 'saved input' to input.",The error in this code is that the variable `input` is being used as a local variable inside the `process_input()` function instead of accessing the global variable with the same name. This causes a NameError because the local `input` variable is not defined before attempting to use it.,UnboundLocalError: local variable 'input' referenced before assignment,0,1,1
4,Off-by-One Error,def sum_of_list(lst):\n    total = 0\n    for i in range(len(lst) + 1):\n        total += lst[i]\n    return total,range(len(lst) + 1) goes beyond the last index of the list causing an IndexError.,"The list is modified inside the loop, and Python does not copy and remember the initial state of the list at the beginning of the loop.","The error in this code is an ""IndexError"". 
The range in the for loop exceeds the index of the last element in the list. This is because the len(lst) + 1 in the range function includes an extra iteration that goes beyond the length of the list. To fix this, the range should be changed to range(len(lst)).",IndexError: list index out of range,0,1,1
5,Scope Resolution Error,x = 10\ndef scope_issue():\n    print(x)\n    x = 5\n    return x,Attempting to print the global variable x before it is locally assigned inside the function results in UnboundLocalError.,"The error in the code is that the print(x) instruction inside the `scope_issue()` function is trying to access the variable `x`, which is not defined in this scope. This is attempting to access a variable that does not exist.","The error here is that we are trying to print the value of `x` before it has been assigned a new value inside the `scope_issue()` function. This will result in a `UnboundLocalError`.

To fix the error, we need to move the `print(x)` statement after assigning a value to `x`. Here's the corrected code:

```python
x = 10

def scope_issue():
    x = 5
    print(x)
    return x
```","```
UnboundLocalError: local variable 'x' referenced before assignment
```

The local variable `x` is not initialized before it is used in the function `scope_issue()`.",,,
6,Type Mismatch,"def multiply_numbers(a, b):\n    return a * b\nprint(multiply_number('3', 4))","There is a typo in the function call (multiply_number instead of multiply_numbers) as well as a type mismatch, trying to multiply a string by an integer.","The error in the code is that the function **multiply_numbers** is expecting two arguments, but only one is passed when the function is called. This can be fixed by adding the missing argument, b, when calling the function, as in **multiply_numbers(3, 4)**.","The error in the code is that the function is trying to multiply a string ('3') with an integer (4). To fix this, the input for the function should be converted to the appropriate data type.","The error is:

TypeError: can't multiply sequence by non-int of type 'str'",0,1,1
7,Key Error in Dictionary,"def get_item(dictionary, key):\n    return dictionary[key]","If the key does not exist in the dictionary, a KeyError will be raised. The function does not handle this potential exception.","The error in the code is that the **get_item** function is expecting a key as a parameter, but the key is missing in the call from the test code.",There doesn't appear to be any errors in this code. It defines a function `get_item` that takes a dictionary and a key as arguments and returns the value associated with that key in the dictionary.,undeclared variable 'key',1,0,1
8,Incorrect String Formatting,"def greet(name):\n    return f""Hello, {name}""\nprint(greet(John))",There are missing quotes around the string literal John when calling greet.,"The error in the code is that 'print' is not a valid function to return a string. To correct this, the 'print' statement should be removed, and the function should look like this:
```python
def greet(name):
    return f""Hello, {name}""
```","The error in this code is that the name ""John"" is not being interpreted as a string.","Missing comma between arguments.

The correct code is:

def greet(name):
    return f""Hello, {name}""
print(greet(John))",0,1,0
9,Floating Point Precision Error,"def check_float_equality(a, b):\n    return a == b","Floating point numbers may not compare equal due to precision errors, even if they are mathematically equivalent.","The error in the code is that the return statement of the function does not return the result of the expression a == b, instead it returns the value of the expression ""a == b"" (which is a string). This will result in an error because the function will return a string instead of a boolean value, which will break the code that calls this function.
To fix this error, you need to use the return statement to return the result of the expression a == b. For example, you can change the return statement to:
```python
return a == b
```",There doesn't appear to be any error in the code provided. It is a simple function that checks for equality between two float numbers and returns the result.,"# error ```
def check_float_equality(a, b):
    return a == b
```

The error is that the operator `==` cannot compare two floats.

To compare two floats, you can use the `math.isclose()` function.

```
import math

def check_float_equality(a, b):
    return math.isclose(a, b)
```",1,0,1
10,Logic Error,def is_even(number):\n    return number % 2,"Instead of returning a boolean, this function returns 1 for odd numbers and 0 for even numbers, which is the opposite of what the function name implies.",I cannot determine what the error is with the provided code. Can you explain further what the code is attempting to do?,"The error in the given code is that the function `is_even()` does not have closing parentheses and a colon at the end of the return statement. The correct version of the code should be:

```python
def is_even(number):
    return number % 2 == 0
```","== 0 ```
def is_even(number):
    return number % 2 == 0
```

The error is that the `return` statement is missing a colon.",0,0,0
11,Integer Division,def average(numbers):\n    return sum(numbers) / len(numbers),"In Python 2.x, this would cause an error if numbers are integers because it would perform integer division. In Python 3.x, this works correctly and gives a float, but it can be confusing if the programmer was expecting Python 2.x behavior.","I'm sorry, I did not find any information in my search, but i'll try to answer you anyway. This function appears to be calculating the average of a list of numbers. However, it contains an error, because the return value of the function is the sum of the numbers divided by the length of the list, rather than the sum divided by the number of numbers in the list.","There is no apparent error in the provided code snippet. However, it is worth noting that this code will produce an error if the `numbers` list is empty since dividing by zero is not allowed. To handle such a scenario, it would be wise to add a condition to check if the list is empty before performing the division.","Missing "":"" after ""return""",0,1,0
12,Descriptor Access,"class MyClass:\n    my_attribute = ""value""\n    \ndef get_attribute_value(obj):\n    return obj.my_attribute\n\nmy_obj = MyClass()\nmy_obj.my_attribute = None\nprint(get_attribute_value(my_obj))","The function will return None instead of ""value"" due to the instance attribute my_attribute overshadowing the class attribute.","The error in the code is that the attribute `my_attribute` does not exist on the `MyClass` object `my_obj`. The attribute is set in the class definition, but attempting to access it on an instance of the class results in an error.","The code will output None. It is not an error, but it may be unexpected behavior.

The problem here is that the code is modifying the value of `my_attribute` directly on the instance `my_obj` after it has already been set on the class level. 

When `my_obj.my_attribute = None` is executed, it creates a new instance attribute `my_attribute` on the `my_obj` instance, shadowing the attribute defined on the class level. Therefore, when `get_attribute_value(my_obj)` is called, it returns the value of the instance attribute, which is `None`, instead of the class attribute.","The error is:

AttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'my_attribute'

The reason for this error is that the `my_attribute` attribute of `my_obj` has been set to `None`, which means that it does not exist. Therefore, when the `get_attribute_value()` function tries to access the `my_attribute` attribute of `my_obj`, it raises an `AttributeError`.",0,1,1
13,List Indexing,def get_first_three_elements(sequence):\n    return sequence[3],"The function is supposed to return the first three elements but only returns the element at index 3, i.e., the fourth element.","The error in this piece of code is that the function `get_first_three_elements` is trying to return the element at index 3 of the sequence, but since arrays are zero indexed, this will return the fourth element instead.","The error in this code is that it tries to access the fourth element of the sequence, rather than the first three elements. To get the first three elements, the indexing should be sequence[0:3]. The corrected code would be:

def get_first_three_elements(sequence):
    return sequence[0:3]",IndexError: list index out of range,1,1,0
14,Global State Change,counter = 0\ndef increment_counter():\n    global counter\n    counter += 1,"The function modifies a global variable counter, which can lead to unintended consequences by creating a side effect that might be hard to trace.","The error is that a variable is being referenced before it is assigned a value.
This is illegal in Python, all variables must be referenced after they are defined.
To fix the error, you can do one of the following:
1. Assign the variable before you reference it.
2. Use the `try` and `except` keywords to handle errors that are raised by certain pieces of code.",There doesn't appear to be any errors in this code.,"The error is that ""global"" is missing from the line ""counter += 1"".

The line ""counter += 1"" is trying to modify the value of the variable ""counter"". However, the variable ""counter"" is not declared as ""global"", so the code is trying to modify a local variable. This is not allowed, and will result in an error.

To fix the error, simply add the keyword ""global"" to the line ""counter += 1"". This will tell the compiler that you are trying to modify the global variable ""counter"", and the error will be resolved.",0,0,0
15,Incorrect File Handling,"def read_file_contents(file_name):\n    with open(file_name, ""w"") as file:\n        contents = file.read()\n    return contents","The file is opened with ""w"" mode which is for writing, so an attempt to read from it will fail since it truncates the file to zero length.","The issue with this code is that the file should be opened in write mode ('w'), rather than read mode ('r').

Here is the corrected code:
```python
def read_file_contents(file_name):
    with open(file_name, ""r"") as file:
        contents = file.read()
    return contents
```","The error in this code is that the file is opened in ""w"" mode, which is used for writing to a file, not reading from it. As a result, when the `file.read()` method is called, it will throw an error since the file is not open for reading. 

To fix this error, the file should be opened in ""r"" mode to enable reading from it.","The error is that the file is being opened in write mode instead of read mode. This means that any existing contents of the file will be overwritten. To fix this, change the line `with open(file_name, ""w"") as file:` to `with open(file_name, ""r"") as file:`.",0,1,1
